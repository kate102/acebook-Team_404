The applications involved in this development:
* Rails
* Devise
* Travis
* Heruko
* GitHub
* Materialize

#### [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
This is a framework for writing Ruby programs. Rails promotes the concept that models, views, and controllers should be kept separate by storing the code for each element as separate files in separate directories. Installing Rails sets up the directory structure and provides a number of modules that facilitate the Model View Controller model. `ActiveRecord` is the business logic and database communication. `ActionView` deals with the presentation of pages returned to the client. `ActionController` handles browser requests and communication between the model and the view.
