## Description

The purpose of this project was two fold, to reproduce the functionality of a social network, using Rails and CI, and to work in teams using Agile practices. 

### The Technical Challenge

The application was to mirror the functionality of the popular social media site, Facebook. The project was to be written in Ruby using the Rails framework.  

The applications involved in this development:

* GitHub
* Rails
* Rubocop Linter
* GitHub
* Devise
* Travis
* Heruko
* Materialize

#### [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
This is a framework for writing Ruby programs. Rails promotes the concept that models, views, and controllers should be kept separate by storing the code for each element as separate files in separate directories. Installing Rails sets up the directory structure and provides a number of modules that facilitate the Model View Controller model. `ActiveRecord` is the business logic and database communication. `ActionView` deals with the presentation of pages returned to the client. `ActionController` handles browser requests and communication between the model and the view. 

#### [Rubocop Linter](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
To ensure that the code is clean and formatted properly we are using Rubocop. This will analyse the code and provide information about where the formatting is not correct.

#### [GitHub](http://www.github.com)
We are using GitHub as a development environment. This enables us to share the source code and work on different branches to ensure that there are no conflicts.

#### [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
Travis is a `Continuous Integration` tool. This enables us to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

#### [Heruko](https://www.heroku.com/)
Heruko is a cloud based repository that enables working prototypes to be made available for client feedback. This facilitates the iterative development process, making us more agile and able to respond to client feedback quickly.

#### [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
This is a user authentication package. It provides all of the complex functionality of user login, validation and encription. Using this has enabled us to avoid `reinventing the wheel`.

#### [Materialize](http://materialize.labs.my/)


#### [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
This is a framework for creating impressive views quickly. It enables you to easily add drop downs and buttons and many other features without writing lines of CSS.

#### [Rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Rubocop is a linter that checks the quality of the code. 

#### Simplecov
This is a Ruby gem that checks the test coverage of the code. It returns a percentage of test coverage that indictaes how much of the code, and therefore functionality, has not got a valid test.
